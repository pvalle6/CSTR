# Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) Simulation
## Overview
This project provides a Python-based simulation and control room GUI for a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). The CSTR is a common type of chemical reactor used in industrial processes where maintaining uniform composition and temperature is essential. This tool aims to simulate the behavior of a CSTR and provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the reactor parameters.

## Features
Dynamic Simulation: Simulate the dynamic behavior of a CSTR under various operating conditions.

Control Room GUI: A graphical user interface that mimics a control room environment for real-time monitoring and control.

Parameter Adjustment: Easily adjust parameters such as feed concentration, flow rate, and reactor temperature.

Plotting and Visualization: Real-time plotting of key reactor variables such as concentration and temperature.

Data Logging: Log simulation data for analysis and review.
## Installation
To get started with the CSTR simulation and control GUI, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/pvalle6/CSTR.git```

```cd CSTR```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```python3 -m venv venv```
```source venv/bin/activate```  # On Windows use ```venv\Scripts\activate```

Install required dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
## Usage
To run the simulation and control room GUI, execute the following command:

python main.py
The GUI will launch, allowing you to interact with the CSTR simulation. Use the control panel to adjust parameters and observe the real-time response of the reactor.
